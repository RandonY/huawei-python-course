    "\tUnderstand meanings of conditional and looping statements in Python.\n",
    "\tUnderstand related operations on conditional and looping statements in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, the \"if\" statement controls execution of a program, and its basic form is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "if judging condition:\n",
    "Execute statement…\n",
    "else:\n",
    "Execute statement …\n",
    "\n",
    "The following statements are executed if the judging condition is true (non-zero). There can be multiple lines of execution statements, which can be indented to indicate the same range. The \"else\" statement is optional, and can be executed when the condition is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Looping statement\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of changes in looping statements. Common statements include the \"for\" statement and the \"while\" statement.\n",
    "In \"for\" looping, the \"for\" statement should be followed by a colon. \"for\" looping is performed in a way similar to iterating. In \"while\" looping, there is a judgment on condition and then looping, like in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python For Loops\n",
    "A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.\n",
    "The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.\n"
